Introduction
------------

The graph below shows the disparity between the U.S. life expectancy between two races. It is a very clear discrepancy highlighted by some disturbing political coincidences.

This display meets the requirements for D4 Mortality - 696 observations - one quantitative continuous variable, life expectancy in years - one ordinal categorical variable in the year - one categorical variables in the form of sex. This graph also meets the requirement for a compelling story, as will be highlighted in a moment.

Ever existing gap between black life expectancy and white life expectancy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon first look at the graph, I have intended to keep the overal design newspaperlike in feeling. I want it to have some of the soberness that reading about a tragedy would have. There is simply no way to easily explain how this is possible withoutbeing baffled. I chose to leave off the legend and make the black line prominently black. It stands out and it is obvious that is is the line of choice. I havealso highlighted the region between 1980 and 1997. If you look particularly at the male char during this time, the growing black life expectancy for males experienxes a drop in slope not felt by the white males.

The region I have selected, upon which this drop falls, is no coincidence. This peroid of time is the height of the drug war, where minorities were being target relentelessly. I wanted to prominently display the data in this section. Also, I drew an extra horizontal line on the graph at 70 years of life expectancy. If you trace this line from the black curve to the white curve, you find that the black life expectancy is 25-50years behind the white curve.

The policy that causes this gap to stop growing is a complete disgrace to our country and society. Nobody should statistically live a less long or fulfilling life simply because of the color of their skin. Since I believe that this disparity is a result of the effects of the drug war and systemic racism, I believe that this graph will compell you my audience to sit down and take hard look at the real and tangible disadvantages that our brothers and sisters with dark skin are born with.
