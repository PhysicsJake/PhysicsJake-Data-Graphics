Tufte, Edward (1997) The decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger. In: *Visual and statistical thinking: Displays of evidence for making decisions.* Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 16--31.

**Prompt:** Tufte says, "Regardless of the indirect cultural causes of the accident, there was a clear proximate cause." Summarize Tufte's explanation of the proximate cause.

**Response:** The proximate cause is that the engineers did not present their data in a clear enough way to prove the correct conclusion that they had made in that the launch should not occur because of the correlation between o-ring damage and temperature.

**Prompt:** Describe the evidence the author presents to support those ideas.

**Response:**
The author creates a pointed graphic that shows a clear correlation between O-ring damage and temperature.

**Prompt:** What data were used in making the decision to launch? What data were not used but should have been used (according to Tufte) in making the launch decision?

**Response:** The test bench data for the rockets, all kinds of different damage and tmeperature data that were unnecessary, as well as all kinds of irrelevant comments were sent and used to make this decision. According to tufte, O-ring damage and temperature were the data that they needed to present to draw this correlation.

**Prompt:** On page 23, Tufte presents a graph that provides visual evidence that the "launch was completely outside the engineering database accumulated in 24 previous flight." Describe the structure of this data set:

-   Number of observations
-   Data structure: classify each variable as quantitative (continuous or discrete) and categorical (nominal or ordinal and number of levels).

**Response:**
24 observations rocket launch - nomical categorial temperature-quantitative continuous damage index - quantitative continuous

**Prompt:** Summarize the main thesis of the paper.

**Response:** The main thesis of the paper is that there are right ways and wrong ways to present data. If the engineers in the Challenger disaster had presented their data correctly to back up their conclusion, they would have had a much better case to prevent this disaster and as such they are at fault.

week 4 reading prompts
----------------------

Wainer, Howard (2014) Fifteen displays about one thing. In: *Medical illuminations: Using evidence, visualization, and statistical thinking to improve healthcare.* UK: Oxford University Press, 32--49.

Definition: "Gram staining" (named after its inventor, the Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram) is a method of staining to distinguish one type of bacterium from another---it can be used as a faster substitute for culturing. Gram staining is a category with two levels: some bacteria are Gram stain negative and some are Gram stain positive. Read more about it on the
[Gram stain Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_stain).

**Prompt:** Reviewing the article carefully, come up with a list of variables. Classify each as quantitative or categorical, and if categorical, the levels.

**Response:**

variable name: Gram Strain

-   type: Categorical Nominal
-   levels (if categorical): 2

variable name: Minimum inhibitory concentration

-   type: Quantitative continuous
-   levels (if categorical):

variable name: Antibiotic

-   type: Categorical Nominal
-   levels (if categorical): 3

variable name: Bacteria

-   type: Categorical Nominal
-   levels (if categorical): 16

**Prompt:** The article title is "Fifteen displays about one thing." After reading the entire article, what is the "one thing?" Note that the "one thing" might imply multiple goals or more than one question.

**Response:** The minimum inhibitory concentration of three antibiotics against positive and negative gram straining bacteria. In other words, which antibiotic should be used to treat a given bacteria.

**Prompt:** In your opinion, which of the 15 displays best answers the question(s) about the "one thing?"

**Response:**
I really like entry 7 - dots.

**Prompt:** Explain why.

**Response:** You can look at a given bacteria and easil see which of the antibiotics would be effective. The gram-positive and gram negative case is shown, but it doesn't dominate the graph in such a way that it is hard to see effectiveness. I can easily look at this graph and say, " Oh, for gram-positive use Penicilin" or "for gram negative use Neomycin."

**Prompt:** Re-read Wainer's conclusion section. What main points does he make about graph design or visual rhetoric that you could apply to your own work this term.

**Response:** The best displays present a coherent, memorable picture of the data. The display must be able to answer a question being asked, so having the question in mind that you want to answer with a graph is very important.

This means that when trying to develop and improve my graphics over time, I have to always keep this question in mind. Also, Wainer states how graphics can always be improved.
