Introduction
------------

The graph below shows the direct correlation between smoking attributed deaths and smoking attributed costs. This particular topic is of great interest to me, as my grandmother, who was my role model growing up, passed away in 2011 of somking related disease. I was interested in looking into the burden on the recipient of this type of treatment by how costs related to deaths.

Correlation between medical expenses and death for the smoking attributed case
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This graph ended up being more cut and dry than I was expecting. While it seems to be the obvious case that smoking atttributed expenses rise as you have more people dying from smoking related diseases, it did not seem this obvious. A correlation test on these two varibles shows a 0.9899 correlation value. This is a high confidence value of a strong correlation between the two. By just laying the data down in the simple scatterplot form, the near linearity of it shows to the eye almost immediately. Nothing appears to be outlying, no story appears to be hidden in plain sight, or even highlighted by this data.

This classic linear correlating scatterplot tells us simply that as more people are fighting and dying of smoking related diseases, the cost goes up. If you leave it at that it is a simple story, and simple graph. However, when it becomes apparent what these numbers actually represent, it becomes quite disconcerting. There are many datasets that show the poorest among the demographics are most likely to smoke, and rigorously at that. This is the same demographic of people who are being deprived of real affordable healthcare, and the burden to pick up the slack where the system is failing these people falls upon the taxpayers.

Next, I would compare the smoking attributable mortality to the annual deaths as a whole, and then possibly compare that to the average income in every state. I think that there will be some sort of correlation between the percentage of deaths attributed to smoking and the economic standing of the states. By exploring more of these options I would be able to get a more clear picture painted in this correlation graph, and I would be able to explain the "compared to what"more readily. I kept this graph simple and clean for the time being, relying on my experience and reason to do the bulk of the talking, and I think that with a little more data I will be able to make a graphic powerful enough to back up my rhetoric.

As for the design of this graph, I added the smoker on oxygen to respect the human suffering aspect of the topic. I took the idea from the week 4 report in revision, and like how it turned out overal. The picture ended up larger than I wanted, but I chose to keep it smooth and symmetric over reducing the size of the picture. The background is kept somber and the data is displayed prominantly. I really want this graph to say that smoking is a burden on our society. It takes away our loved ones, it stresses our economy, raises healthcare premiums, and picks up more cancer victims daily. The sheer number of spending and deaths, nearly 25 Billion in cost and 40,000 deaths a year in California alone, should prompt us to prevent our children from ever beginning to smoke. It begs all kinds of questions when you hear this number. Where does all of this money go? How do we continue to let tobacco companies and their supporters affect our health and economy in such a way? With more time and data collection, I think that this simple correlation could grow into a powerful graphic.
