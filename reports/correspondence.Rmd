**RL**  D7 presentation notes.

**RL**  D6 presentation notes. 

Assign an alpha value to the density plots so they are somewhat transparent 

What can you conclude for the density graphs? From the correlation values? From the box plots? etc.

Place a number in the panels you intend to discuss so you can refer to them in the critique. 

Are these the two  most commonly used materials?

You could also separate out the unimportant variables and show them in a separate graph. 

Critique should conclude with a discussion of how i use this graph to select a material for a particular application. Use examples. 






**RL**  D5 presentation notes.  


The problem is that CO2 per ton of oil doesn't help us with climate change 

plot the CO2 tons as a raw number

maybe per capita oil consumption in another graph 

Compared to what? Look at other climate science articles on emissions and see what they compare to

**RL**  D4 presentation notes. 

If ggsave doesn't work, try png() function followed by dev.off() 

vertical bands that might explain the drop in life exp., e.g., WW1, WW2, policy changes such as the start of medicare/medicaid, the start of social security, tobacco advertising banned

compared to what? other industrialized countries? 

facet on sex?

facet on income bracket might be informative? or income inequality?

**RL**  D3 presentation notes

No graph today :(. 

Data carpentry issues. Please try and see me during office hours so we can fix these issues early. Also, please work on the tutorials to get the practice you need.

**RL**  D2 presentation notes. 

Change Race to Race/Ethnicity 

Change arrests to arrests as percent of that population in the incorporated area  

Factor recode race/ethnicity factor to lump together small related levels, e.g., East Asian, Pacific Islander, etc. 

Also, the forcats package has a function for recoding "everything else" into a single category. (see the text)

**RL**  D1 presentation notes. 

The introduction you gave us verbally is the basis for a written introduction in the report. 

Order the departments by the median of the salaries. The number of employees for each department could be added as a bar chart to the right of the graph. 

Us the cut() to bin the all salary data, y-axis is the range, three box plots per range. Use the number of employees in each group as the x axis. 




### 2019-03-25

**RL** The links on the README page all work. No problems so far. 

I don't see any data. I would have hoped that by now you would have been examining some data for graphing, even if a graph wasn't ready. I can't emphasize enough how important it is that you work ahead on acquiring data that meets the data requirements for the various displays. This is the single most important obstacle that has kept past students from being as successful as they might have been.
