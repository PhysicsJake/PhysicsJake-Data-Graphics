**RL**  D1 presentation notes. 

The introduction you gave us verbally is the basis for a written introduction in the report. 

Order the departments by the median of the salaries. The number of employees for each department could be added as a bar chart to the right of the graph. 

Us the cut() to bin the all salary data, y-axis is the range, three box plots per range. Use the number of employees in each group as the x axis.

**RL** The links on the README page all work. No problems so far. 

I don't see any data. I would have hoped that by now you would have been examining some data for graphing, even if a graph wasn't ready. I can't emphasize enough how important it is that you work ahead on acquiring data that meets the data requirements for the various displays. This is the single most important obstacle that has kept past students from being as successful as they might have been.
