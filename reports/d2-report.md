2010 - 2013 Los Angeles Crime Data
----------------------------------

Below is a graph that highlights the racial distribution of all of the crimes documented by the LAPD from 2010-2011.

The figure above is a multiway distribution using the LAPD's openly published data on all of their arrests from 2010 - 2013.I have chosen to sort the data by the largest arrest count to easily show outliers. Having the ability to show the outliers against an expected "curve" allows me to be able to show what my real point is. This is the main purpose of the carpentry and display of this data. It shows where the unexpected number of arrests occur. The outliers are where the real story is told in this data. Along the top row of the graph, The arrests are mostly Hispanic for all regions. This is a disproportionate amount, even to the highly hispanic population of these areas of Los Angeles.

Another interesting conclusion that is drawn from the graphs is the high number of arrests for Blacks and Hispanics in Southern LA. These arrest patterns line up with the often scrutinized gang violence problem that exists between the primary black and primary hispanic areas in the Southern part of the city.

I chose to take the number of observations of all of these crimes and plot them in this multiway distribution format in order to give a crime overview for the city of Los Angeles as it relates to racial demographic and location. I was not at this time interested in the individual crimes and other demographics that are listen by the LAPD, nor the demographics of the victims. I chose to make it a summary of pure number of crimes in order to show what trends arrests have in these demographics. This brought me to the story of the disproportionate arrests of Hispanics in some districts, as well as the indication that gang violence is still prominent in the southern part of the city.
