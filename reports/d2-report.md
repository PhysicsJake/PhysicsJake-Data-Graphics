Introduction
------------

Below is a graph that highlights the racial distribution of all of the crimes documented by the LAPD from 2010-2013.

This display meets the requirements for D2 Multiway - 332 observations - Race/Ethnicity which is categorical and has 8 levels - Location in LA which is categorical, 21 levels - One quantitative variable is Arrests/1000

The figure above is a multiway distribution using the LAPD's openly published data on all of their arrests from 2010 - 2013.I have chosen to sort the data by the largest arrest count to easily show outliers. Having the ability to show the outliers against an expected "curve" allows me to be able to show what my real point is. This is the main purpose of the carpentry and display of this data. It shows where the unexpected number of arrests occur. The outliers are where the real story is told in this data. Along the top row of the graph, The arrests are mostly Hispanic for all regions. This is a disproportionate amount, even to the highly hispanic population of these areas of Los Angeles. I am still looking for appropriate accompanying population demographics, as that would provide the real context and story to this data.

Another interesting conclusion that is drawn from the graphs is the high number of arrests for Blacks and Hispanics in Southern LA. These arrest patterns line up with the often scrutinized gang violence problem that exists between the primary black and primary hispanic areas in the Southern part of the city.

I beleive that given the demographic numbers, it would be much easier to see the race discrepancies that are very much prevelant in today's society and that take center stage in the media that we see on a daily basis.

As far as the design of the graph, I chose to keep this data as uncluttered as possible, by both pulling out outliers and grouping them into a new variable. This gives the graph a full but not overly cluttered look that just shows the data. Again, I am looking forward to finding some population data to really give this visual some incredible depth in the future.
