Dragga, Sam & Dan Voss (2001) Cruel pies: The inhumanity of technical illustrations. *Technical Communication* 48(3): 265--274.

**Prompt:** Explain how the prevalent treatment of ethics in visual communication is lacking.

**Response:** Almost all of the current ethics discusisons within data visualization work with the honesty and integrity of the visualizations. They focus on the graphical lies and misrepresentation of data through graphics to deceive an audience that is looking for a simple method of understanding data. Tufte himself focuses on this part of ethics very heavily. This means that the humanity and physical impact of many of the subjects is not taken into account when designing the data graphics.

**Prompt:** Explain the purpose of "humanizing" data displays depicting human suffering or death.

**Response:** Humanizing data displays gives the reader a true depth or gravity of the situations being displayed by this type of data. It can make the rhetoric of the graphics more impactful to an audience, as instead of numbers and lines, it is more apparent that real living things are being represented by the graphics in front of them.

**Prompt:** Consider the authors' attempts at redesigning such data displays. Did one in particular strike you as ineffective? Explain

**Response:** Figure 9 is particularly ineffective in my eyes. The little clip art of the lumberjack is cartoonish in nature and does not really give the intended impact. It rather just clutters the graphic.

**Prompt:** Did one in particular strike you as effective? Explain.

**Response:** Figure 8 is a good improvement on the orignal. The quote really takes the subject matter and amplifies it. However, the pie chart in general is not the best way to display the information, so I do not like it for that reason.

Figures 10 and 11 do a good job of making the humanity of the subject matter apparent and shocking. However, the large graphics are rather distracting for me. I would like a combination of the quote style from the graph 8 and a smaller graphic adjoining the graph to show this. I also think that the rhetoric before and after the graphics are most important in setting up what the subject matter means. I think that the arts that accompany them should remind the reader of this rhetoric and they should support each other.
