## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Citation

Tufte shows us that without the proper visual rhetoric, important points can be missed by the audience. This could result in uninformed decision making.[@Tufte:1997]
