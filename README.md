Introduction
------------

This portfolio includes data and graphics for both my personal and professional work.It is a constant, evergrowing aggregate of my work.It is displayed in the clearest and most efective ways possible and is wholly my own.

Displays and critiques
----------------------

[Display 1](reports/d1-report.md) 2018 Ohio State University Annual Base Salary Review This report showcases a box plot with Annual Base Salary data for The Ohio State University. The data comes directly from their website at <https://apps.hr.osu.edu/salaries/> . In this report, the annual base salaries are compared across three depratments in the university. These departments are the university itself, its athletic department, and its adjunct health system. Since Ohio State is know widely for their althetics, I wanted to take an in depth look at where the real hiring priorities for the university lie.

[Display 2](reports/d2-report.md) 2010-2013 Crime and Arrest data from the Los Angeles Police Department. This graph compares the number of arrests in each area of Los Angeles for each reported race.

[Display 5](reports/d5-gas-report.md) 2014 BP Statistical Review on World energy, and its attempts to quiet the opposition of big oil and gas.
