Introduction
------------

Welcome to my presentation of data graphics! Below is the work stemming from my work into developing skills in the field of data visulaizations. Topics range from useful 3D printing metrics to heart wrenching truths about the social state of our country. I hope that you are able to dive into the data along with the messages that they convey, and that you might leave my repository having gained a little bit of knowdledge, or at least a desire to investingate further into there presented topics.

As it stands, the portfolio below is an collection of my graphical work done for the purpose of Rose Hulman's ME 447 (Visualizing Data) Class. It containes 7 graphs containing a myriad of wide range of different topics. Design and Rhetoric principles from established R community members and data visualization expert were considered when designing the graphics and writing the accompying rhetoric. This purpose of this portfolio under the class discription was to design truthful and compelling data visuals. I have added my personal interests and research, along with my person insight into how the data should be construed in order to reach this goal. I invite any and all discussion and criticism, and would invite you to contact me at <physicsjakedata@gmail.com>.

[College Salary Data Draft](reports/d1-report.md) 2018 Ohio State University Annual Base Salary Review

This report showcases a box plot with Annual Base Salary data for The Ohio State University. The data comes directly from their website at <https://apps.hr.osu.edu/salaries/> . In this report, the annual base salaries are compared across three depratments in the university. These departments are the university itself, its athletic department, and its adjunct health system. Since Ohio State is know widely for their althetics, I wanted to take an in depth look at where the real hiring priorities for the university lie.
